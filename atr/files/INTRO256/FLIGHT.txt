The original idea had been to try to
squeeze a Mandelbrot fractal into
256b, but that appeared to be not
doable due to the amount of
computations involved. This is the
result of playing around with the
original base function with the aim
of making it simpler and faster while
still fairly interesting in terms of
its graphical representation.
