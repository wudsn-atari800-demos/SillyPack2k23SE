These are new datadiscs for my game
Zdendazuma II., which was published
in Abbuc-magazine last year. That's
why I'm not sending the game, but
only the data discs - they are all
NEW, not published yet.

Every datadisk contains 40 original
rooms, every datadisk therefore is an 
independent game.

I programmed all of this because I
think that the original Montezuma is
the most beautiful game anyone has
ever made - and with my game I wanted
to express my admiration and respect
for the author of how much I love the
original.

Attention: This game saves score and
loads rooms from disk, so if you play
it in an emulator, set this ATR to
R/W in the drive!

I would also like to point out that
there are about 110 rooms in the
original Montezuma - but many rooms
are used even 8 times. I only have 40
rooms in each data disk, but EVERY
ONE IS DIFFERENT. So I have more
rooms than the original!

Points of Interest:
- if someone likes both persons
  (Pedro/Monty), then Datadisk 01
  is played like the other one
- Datadisk 02 is (with a couple of
  exceptions) only black and white
- Datadisk 03 has shields instead of
  swords, bags full of money instead
  of points, a little different
  ladders and bricks
- Datadisk 04 has different keys, ...
- Datadisk 05 is in a winter
  environment and EXITS TO NEXT ROOMS
  ARE HARD TO FIND (this is very
  frustrating for players!)
- Datadisk 06 is from Egypt and
  the player only falls down the
  whole game

Note: All datadisks need to be run
from disk drive "D1"!


The datadisks come separately and
are included in the download as
"SV2k23SE_ZENDAZUMA_..atr".
