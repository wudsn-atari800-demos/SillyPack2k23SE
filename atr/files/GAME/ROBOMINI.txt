Info:    Mono

This game is for two players. Both
run on the same playfield, regardless
of the opponent's position.

Whoever is first to a certain diamond
takes it and the opponent can no
longer see that diamond.

PLUS increases the player's time.
MINUS decreases the opponent's time.

There are 30 diamonds in each level.
As a tribute to the game Boulder
Dash, which I used to like very much,
I drew some objects from this game
and used them.

Music and sounds in this game are
composed by PG.

Background Information
======================

Hello !

Sorry for my bad English.
I am a programmer from the Czech
Republic. I have programmed games
such as Pacman labyrinth, Space
invaders battle, Ufon, Ninja-help-
icopter, Robbery, Fire fighter Tobik,
ZdendaZuma I., ZdendaZuma II.,
Multijoy roulette for 17-players
(16 players play with a joystick via
multijoy and the last one on the
keyboard as a croupier), Bombeeno,
Atari hotline, ... 
but they are all already published.

That's why I'm sending to your
competition only the games that I
have programmed for the past and this
year - those are the ones that I
haven't published yet anywhere.

I confirm that I wrote all these
games myself, every one byte. I'm
writing this mainly because of the
ZdendaZuma-Datadisks, so that no one
asks if I used Montezuma's original
code. No, I didn't use the original
code, because I can't read other
people's code.

If someone comes to the Czech
Republic to Cesky Budejovice, they
can view my complete source codes :)

When I tested all games on the
original Atari 800XL without any
modifications - all worked fine. 
From a 1050 drive and also from old
AVG Cart.

When I tested all games on the
original Atari 600XL with new SUB
AVG Cart, sometimes option SETTINGS
/ POKEY EMULATION needed to be OFF.

All games requires dissiable BASIC
So press OPTION when you start them.
