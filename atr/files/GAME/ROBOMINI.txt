Hello !

Sorry for my bad English.
I am a programmer from the Czech Republic.
I have programmed games such as Pacman labyrinth, Space invaders battle, Ufon, Ninja-help-icopter, Robbery, Fire fighter Tobik, ZdendaZuma I., ZdendaZuma II.,
Multijoy roulette for 17-players (16 players play with a joystick via multijoy and the last one on the keyboard as a croupier), Bombeeno, Atari hotline, ... but they are all already published.
That's why I'm sending to your competition only the games that I have programmed for the past and this year - those are the ones that I haven't published yet anywhere.

I confirm that I wrote all these games myself, every one byte.
I'm writing this mainly because of the ZdendaZuma-Datadisks, so that no one asks if I used Montezuma's original code.
No, I didn't use the original code, because I can't read other people's code.
If someone comes to the Czech Republic to Cesky Budejovice, they can view my complete source codes :)

When I tested all games on the original Atari 800XL without any modifications - all worked fine. From Drive 1050 and also from old AVG Cart.
When I tested all games on the original Atari 600XL with new SUB AVG Cart, sometimes option SETTINGS / POKEY EMULATION needed to be OFF.

All games requires disconnected BASIC - so press OPTION when you start tham.

Robot and Minion

This game is for two players.
Both run on the same playing field, regardless of the opponent's position.
Whoever is first to a certain diamond takes it and the opponent can no longer see that diamond.
PLUS increases the player's time, MINUS decreases the opponent's time.
There are 30 diamonds in each level.
As a tribute to the game Boulder Dash, which I used to like very much, I drew some objects from this game and used them.
Music and sounds in this game are by PG.
