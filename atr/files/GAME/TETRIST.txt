Hello !

Sorry for my bad English.
I am a programmer from the Czech Republic.
I have programmed games such as Pacman labyrinth, Space invaders battle, Ufon, Ninja-help-icopter, Robbery, Fire fighter Tobik, ZdendaZuma I., ZdendaZuma II.,
Multijoy roulette for 17-players (16 players play with a joystick via multijoy and the last one on the keyboard as a croupier), Bombeeno, Atari hotline, ... but they are all already published.
That's why I'm sending to your competition only the games that I have programmed for the past and this year - those are the ones that I haven't published yet anywhere.

I confirm that I wrote all these games myself, every one byte.
I'm writing this mainly because of the ZdendaZuma-Datadisks, so that no one asks if I used Montezuma's original code.
No, I didn't use the original code, because I can't read other people's code.
If someone comes to the Czech Republic to Cesky Budejovice, they can view my complete source codes :)

When I tested all games on the original Atari 800XL without any modifications - all worked fine. From Drive 1050 and also from old AVG Cart.
When I tested all games on the original Atari 600XL with new SUB AVG Cart, sometimes option SETTINGS / POKEY EMULATION needed to be OFF.

All games requires disconnected BASIC - so press OPTION when you start tham.

What will be the next cube is written at the top left corner.
