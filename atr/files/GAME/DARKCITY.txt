The goal of the game is to kill 10
persons. The playfield is quite large
in this game: 48 mode-lines, each 
line is 256 bytes (full page) wide.
Fuel can be refilled at the gas
station at any time. If you crash
your car, no problem - the game
continues. I just put you back at the
beginning. If you run out of fuel,
it's game over.

And if you manage to kill all 10
persons, you win the game !
