Hello !

Sorry for my bad English.
I am a programmer from the Czech Republic.
I have programmed games such as Pacman labyrinth, Space invaders battle, Ufon, Ninja-help-icopter, Robbery, Fire fighter Tobik, ZdendaZuma I., ZdendaZuma II.,
Multijoy roulette for 17-players (16 players play with a joystick via multijoy and the last one on the keyboard as a croupier), Bombeeno, Atari hotline, ... but they are all already published.
That's why I'm sending to your competition only the games that I have programmed for the past and this year - those are the ones that I haven't published yet anywhere.

I confirm that I wrote all these games myself, every one byte.
I'm writing this mainly because of the ZdendaZuma-Datadisks, so that no one asks if I used Montezuma's original code.
No, I didn't use the original code, because I can't read other people's code.
If someone comes to the Czech Republic to Cesky Budejovice, they can view my complete source codes :)

When I tested all games on the original Atari 800XL without any modifications - all worked fine. From Drive 1050 and also from old AVG Cart.
When I tested all games on the original Atari 600XL with new SUB AVG Cart, sometimes option SETTINGS / POKEY EMULATION needed to be OFF.

All games requires disconnected BASIC - so press OPTION when you start tham.

The goal of the game is to kill 10 persons.
The playfield is quite large in this game - 48 mode-lines, each 256 bytes (full page) wide.
Fuel can be refilled at the gas station at any time.
If you crash your car, no problem - the game continues (I just put you back at the beginning).
If you run out of fuel, it's game over.
And if you manage to kill all 10 persons, you win the game !
The author of the music in this game is Poison.
The author of the design of the car is by PG.
